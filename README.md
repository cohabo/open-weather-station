# Open Weather Station

## THE IDEA
To construct a fully open source, open hardware weather station, which publishes it's data in realtime via an open data API on the web.

The main interest in this project is to get an understanding of the full data-processing from getting the data from a sensor to the data presentation on the web - everything the open way. This will bring together some re-occuring challenges of hardware and software engineering, like power supply (limations, efficency), sensors (resolution, calibration), housing (maintainance, materials), data transmission (protocolls, checks), documentation (how, where) and web-presentation (API, visualization, maintainance).

In this repository, all materials will be collected, organized and discussed.

**TIMELINE**
The project is planned for the year 2017 to happen - from research and planning to the construction of it. 

| Time     | Activity       |
|---------------|--------------|
| March - Mai | Research: Setting up requirements and solutions. |
| June - July | Plan the design and source the parts. |
| September | Constructing: First running version with basic functionality (minimum: housing with hardware, temperature measurement, open data api, line-chart). |
| October - ... | Continous improvement of software and hardware. |

## BASIC REQUIREMENTS V1
Open Hardware Weather Station. The first version should have a case with a temperature sensor, which transmits the data onto a server in the web in realtime. The server then offers the data via an open data api endpoint and plots an up-to-date line-chart of the measurements on a website. After this basic setup, the weather station should 

### General
- fully open: open source code, open hardware, open educational resources
- easy to improve, adapt and extend
- easy to copy
- easy to maintain and repair (software and hardware)
- good quality of measurements
- durable against physical and chemical effects (strong wind, hail, strong rain, uv, sand)
- as cheap as possible

**Questions:**
- what copyright license applies to: source code, raw data and documentation

### Board
Arduino or Raspberry Pi or something else i guess. Power supply is a central question: how much power is needed? How often should the data be pushed on the server?

The data must be stored on the board locally, so that a data transfer loss does not lead to a data loss. 

**Requirements:**
- new sensors should be easy to add and attach (sw and hw)
- protect electrical boards from outer influences
- report errors to user
- monitoring functions for sensors and other weather station parameters.

**Questions:**
- Arduino or Raspy?
- Which data should be stored how on the server?
- how and when should the collected data be deleted?
- Is a on/off button needed for the general power supply?

### Sensors
- Specification
- Calibration: cheap, Certificate
- low power usage
- high resolution
- low measuring error

**Questions:**
- What is the best temporal resolution for the measurement?
- What sensor must be in the weather station, and which one should be optional as extensions later on?
- How will the timestamp be created?

### Housing

**Requirements:**
- Protect the hardware from outer damage
- Safeguard correct measurements of the sensors inside
- durable
- stable and easy mounting

Housing for the weather station. 

**Questions:**
- Maybe there is already a plan on the web to create one in a 3D printer or by wood.
- which material is best for this: wood, plastic, steel, 
- What are the general requirements for an official weather station?

### Data Transmission: Weather Station 2 Server
How should the data be transfered from the weather station to the server? Via httprest PUT method? 

**Requirements:**
- no data loss
- save power
- as fast as possible and reasonable. realtime prefered. 

**Questions:**
- should only changes be transmitted?

### Server
Small server to host the data and the webservice. 

**Requirements:**
- postgreSQL
- Python3
- Flask
- handle endless numbers of weather stations

### API
Open data API of the measurements. 

**Requirements:**
- metadata of sensors
	- resolution
	- limits
- calibration certificates
- sensor data: 
	- value
	- timestamp
	- timestamp data arrived at server
	- timestamp measurement
	- result measurement
- Open: Publlic Domain

**Questions:**
- Which software to use for it? Flask?
- How to deliver documents via the API?

### Monitoring Frontend
Monitor and control the weather station at a web-frontend.

**Requirements:**
- only accessible for logged-in user
- user registration
- responsive
- monitor:
	- data logging: last measures, is it working correctly?, each sensor seperatly, 
	- power supply: actual status, time to work, line-chart
	- data transmission: last transmission, is it working correctly?, line-chart
	- values: outliers, unreasonable results, 
	- error log
	- alerts: send sms when critical problems occure

- control:
	- reset computer
	- change measuring intervalls
	- activate/deactivate sensors
	- alarm: set limits for measurements and other parameters

**Questions:**
- is there a working solution for this?

### Web-Visualization
Visualize the measurements for everyone accessible on a web-frontend. Use the API for data access.

**Requirements:**
- measures (line chart): default timeintervall, change timeintervall, 
- change of results (line chart): default timeintervall, change timeintervall, 
- download plots as PNG, SVG and CSV.
- distribution of measures: default timeintervall, change timeintervall, 
- average values: default timeintervall, change timeintervall, 
- responsive
- map with all weather stations

**Questions:**
- Pandas and matplotlib oder D3?


## ADVANCED REQUIREMENTS

### Sensors

**Requirements:**
- insolation

### Alexa 
Connect Amazon Alexa to the data/api.

### Solarpanel

**Requirements:**
- supply the weather station with power
- store power for night and bad weather

**Questions:**
- how much power is needed for the sensors and the hardware? This depends a lot on the sensors used and how often they measure, next to the operation and sending of the computer.

### Camera

Create pictures each day at certain timespots over a full year for automated image analysis.

**Requirements:**
- low power needed
- small housing

**Questions:**
- What resolution is enough?
- How to keep the lens clean?
- How to do the power supply?

### Infrared Camera

## PLANING

## SOURCING
Will be done after design is finished, 1-2 weeks before the construction session.

Shops:
- Conrad
- Amazon
- RS Components

### Parts List


## CONSTRUCTION

This will be done in a 3-5 days makeathon, most likely happening in August/September 2017 in VÃ¶cklabruck, Austria.

## IMPROVMENTS

The project lives in the spirit of open source development and should never be perceived as finished. It should constantly improve: add new sensors, web-visualizations or functionalities in general.
